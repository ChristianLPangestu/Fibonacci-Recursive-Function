# Fibonacci Recursive Function

## Overview

This project contains a simple implementation of a recursive function to compute Fibonacci numbers in C. The function `fibo_r` takes an integer `x` as input and returns the `x`-th Fibonacci number.

## Fibonacci Sequence

The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers in which each number (Fibonacci number) is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. The sequence commonly starts as:
```
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...
```

## Function Implementation

The function `fibo_r` is defined as follows:

```c
int fibo_r(int x) {
    if((x == 1) || (x == 0)) {
        return(x);
    } else {
        return(fibo_r(x - 1) + fibo_r(x - 2));
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **Base Case:** 
  - If `x` is 0 or 1, the function returns `x`. These are the base cases of the Fibonacci sequence.
  
- **Recursive Case:**
  - For other values of `x`, the function returns the sum of the `(x-1)`-th and `(x-2)`-th Fibonacci numbers, effectively breaking the problem down into smaller subproblems.

## Usage

### Compilation

To compile the program containing the `fibo_r` function, use a C compiler like `gcc`. Assuming your file is named `fibonacci.c`, you can compile it with:

```sh
gcc -o fibonacci fibonacci.c
```

### Execution

After compilation, you can run the program with:

```sh
./fibonacci
```

### Example

Here's an example of how you might use the `fibo_r` function in a program:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int fibo_r(int x) {
    if((x == 1) || (x == 0)) {
        return(x);
    } else {
        return(fibo_r(x - 1) + fibo_r(x - 2));
    }
}

int main() {
    int n;
    printf("Enter an integer: ");
    scanf("%d", &n);
    printf("Fibonacci number at position %d is %d\n", n, fibo_r(n));
    return 0;
}
```

In this example, the program prompts the user to enter an integer, and then it computes and prints the corresponding Fibonacci number using the `fibo_r` function.

## Performance Note

While the recursive approach to calculating Fibonacci numbers is straightforward and easy to understand, it is not the most efficient due to its exponential time complexity. For larger values of `x`, this implementation can be very slow. Alternative methods such as iterative computation or memoization can be used to improve performance.
